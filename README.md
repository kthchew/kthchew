## About Me

I like making stuff. Unless stated otherwise, nothing here is affiliated with any of my school(s) and/or employer(s), whether from the past or present.

Here's some of my projects that I'm most fond of:

- [CatCorp](https://github.com/kthchew/CatCorp) - A React app to encourage and gamify productivity by rewarding students for submitting assignments in their Canvas LMS.
  - Other major contributors (in no particular order): [Jason Lin](https://github.com/jasonlin15), [Maximilian Meiler](https://github.com/MaximilianMeiler), [Samuel Christensen](https://github.com/S-Christensen)
- [AMBerDisk](https://amberdisk.kpchew.com/) - A macOS app to run actions or block disks on automount, published on the App Store.
- [ao3-rss](https://github.com/kthchew/ao3-rss) - A Flask app to generate Atom/RSS feeds for works on AO3.

I also like [contributing to other open source projects](https://github.com/search?q=author%3Akthchew+is%3Apr+-user%3Akthchew&type=pullrequests).
